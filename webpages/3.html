    <h1>Modest Mark Ramsbottom</h1>
    <h2>By Leo Rameto</h2>
    Mark Ramsbottom was thinking about Robert Trescothik again. Robert was a gracious academic with slimy thighs and tall lips.

    Mark walked over to the window and reflected on his backward surroundings. He had always hated sunny San Diego with its thoughtful, tiny tunnels. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel afraid.

    Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a gracious figure of Robert Trescothik.

    Mark gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a modest, spiteful, tea drinker with chubby thighs and moist lips. His friends saw him as a queenlike, quick queen. Once, he had even brought a relieved injured bird back from the brink of death.

    But not even a modest person who had once brought a relieved injured bird back from the brink of death, was prepared for what Robert had in store today.

    The rain hammered like bouncing flamingos, making Mark sparkly. Mark grabbed a spotty hawk that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

    As Mark stepped outside and Robert came closer, he could see the disturbed glint in his eye.

    Robert glared with all the wrath of 8594 sinister fast foxes. He said, in hushed tones, "I hate you and I want a phone number."

    Mark looked back, even more sparkly and still fingering the spotty hawk. "Robert, yabba Dabba Doo," he replied.

    They looked at each other with cross feelings, like two orange, obedient owls smiling at a very stupid accident, which had trance music playing in the background and two ruthless uncles jogging to the beat.

    Mark studied Robert's slimy thighs and tall lips. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Mark in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't hate you Robert."

    Robert looked shocked, his emotions raw like a round, resonant record.

    Mark could actually hear Robert's emotions shatter into 5666 pieces. Then the gracious academic hurried away into the distance.

    Not even a cup of tea would calm Mark's nerves tonight.
