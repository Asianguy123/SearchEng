    <h1>Modest Mark Ramsbottom</h1>
    <h2>By Leo Rameto</h2>
    Mark Ramsbottom was thinking about Robert Trescothik again. Robert was a gracious academic with slimy thighs and tall lips.

    Mark walked over to the window and reflected on his backward surroundings. He had always hated sunny San Diego with its thoughtful, tiny tunnels. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel afraid.

    Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a gracious figure of Robert Trescothik.

    Mark gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a modest, spiteful, tea drinker with chubby thighs and moist lips. His friends saw him as a queenlike, quick queen. Once, he had even brought a relieved injured bird back from the brink of death.

    But not even a modest person who had once brought a relieved injured bird back from the brink of death, was prepared for what Robert had in store today.

    The rain hammered like bouncing flamingos, making Mark sparkly. Mark grabbed a spotty hawk that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.
