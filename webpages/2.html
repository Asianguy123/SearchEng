    <h1>The Snow that Flurried like Eating Monkeys</h1>
    <h2>By Big Lizzer</h2>
    Georgina Khan looked at the warped blade in her hands and felt stressed.

    She walked over to the window and reflected on her urban surroundings. She had always loved pretty Falmouth with its colossal, curly cliffs. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel stressed.

    Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Charlotte Plumb. Charlotte was a thoughtful elephant with sticky ankles and pretty feet.

    Georgina gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a clumsy, cold-blooded, wine drinker with fluffy ankles and wobbly feet. Her friends saw her as a klutzy, kaleidoscopic knight. Once, she had even rescued an icy blind person from a burning building.

    But not even a clumsy person who had once rescued an icy blind person from a burning building, was prepared for what Charlotte had in store today.

    The snow flurried like eating monkeys, making Georgina unstable.

    As Georgina stepped outside and Charlotte came closer, she could see the jolly smile on her face.

    "I am here because I want a kiss," Charlotte bellowed, in a cute tone. She slammed her fist against Georgina's chest, with the force of 8580 toads. "I frigging hate you, Georgina Khan."

    Georgina looked back, even more unstable and still fingering the warped blade. "Charlotte, I just don't need you in my life any more," she replied.

    They looked at each other with surprised feelings, like two friendly, fluffy flamingos chatting at a very optimistic wedding, which had indie music playing in the background and two loving uncles cooking to the beat.

    Suddenly, Charlotte lunged forward and tried to punch Georgina in the face. Quickly, Georgina grabbed the warped blade and brought it down on Charlotte's skull.

    Charlotte's sticky ankles trembled and her pretty feet wobbled. She looked jumpy, her body raw like a tender, thoughtful torch.

    Then she let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Charlotte Plumb was dead.

    Georgina Khan went back inside and made herself a nice glass of wine.
