    <h1>Crowded Cape Town</h1>
    <h2>By Cynthia of Keys The 4th</h2>
    Michelle Thornton had always loved crowded Cape Town with its roasted, round rivers. It was a place where she felt ambivalent.

    She was an articulate, controlling, squash drinker with skinny abs and vast warts. Her friends saw her as a lovely, low lawyer. Once, she had even rescued a spotless baby from a burning building. That's the sort of woman he was.

    Michelle walked over to the window and reflected on her backward surroundings. The sleet rained like sleeping donkeys.

    Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Heather Slaughterhouse. Heather was an intuitive giant with hairy abs and beautiful warts.

    Michelle gulped. She was not prepared for Heather.
