    <h1>Urban Sludgeside</h1>
    <h2>By Eve</h2>
    Matthew Noris had always loved urban Sludgeside with its lovely, large lakes. It was a place where he felt irritable.

    He was a peculiar, kind, beer drinker with ginger warts and wobbly abs. His friends saw him as an angry, agreeable author. Once, he had even rescued a squiggled blind person from a burning building. That's the sort of man he was.

    Matthew walked over to the window and reflected on his hilly surroundings. The sleet rained like smiling aardvarks.

    Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Roger Superhalk. Roger was a stupid muppet with ruddy warts and beautiful abs.

    Matthew gulped. He was not prepared for Roger.

    As Matthew stepped outside and Roger came closer, he could see the disturbed glint in his eye.

    Roger gazed with the affection of 5828 delightful boiled blue bottles. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a wifi code."

    Matthew looked back, even more barmy and still fingering the spotty hat. "Roger, eat my shorts," he replied.

    They looked at each other with angry feelings, like two grubby, gentle gerbils gyrating at a very daring accident, which had indie music playing in the background and two ruthless uncles drinking to the beat.

    Matthew studied Roger's ruddy warts and beautiful abs. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Matthew in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Roger."

    Roger looked happy, his emotions raw like a high, hilarious hawk.

    Matthew could actually hear Roger's emotions shatter into 9853 pieces. Then the stupid muppet hurried away into the distance.

    Not even a drink of beer would calm Matthew's nerves tonight.
