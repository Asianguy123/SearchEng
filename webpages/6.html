    <h1>Urban Sludgeside</h1>
    <h2>By Eve</h2>
    Matthew Noris had always loved urban Sludgeside with its lovely, large lakes. It was a place where he felt irritable.

    He was a peculiar, kind, beer drinker with ginger warts and wobbly abs. His friends saw him as an angry, agreeable author. Once, he had even rescued a squiggled blind person from a burning building. That's the sort of man he was.

    Matthew walked over to the window and reflected on his hilly surroundings. The sleet rained like smiling aardvarks.

    Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Roger Superhalk. Roger was a stupid muppet with ruddy warts and beautiful abs.

    Matthew gulped. He was not prepared for Roger.

    As Matthew stepped outside and Roger came closer, he could see the disturbed glint in his eye.
