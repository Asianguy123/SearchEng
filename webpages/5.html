    <h1>The Snow that Flurried like Running Puppies</h1>
    <h2>By Dave</h2>
    James Parkes had always loved urban Madrid with its grieving, glorious gates. It was a place where he felt sparkly.

    He was a witty, thoughtful, port drinker with pink lips and tall ankles. His friends saw him as a pleasant, pongy painter. Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved a cautious chicken. That's the sort of man he was.

    James walked over to the window and reflected on his pretty surroundings. The snow flurried like running puppies.

    Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Harry Wishmonger. Harry was a sinister elephant with wide lips and red ankles.

    James gulped. He was not prepared for Harry.

    As James stepped outside and Harry came closer, he could see the easy glint in his eye.

    Harry gazed with the affection of 1672 popular gigantic guppies. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a resolution."

    James looked back, even more active and still fingering the minuscule newspaper. "Harry, I'm in love with you," he replied.

    They looked at each other with healthy feelings, like two resonant, rabblesnatching rats talking at a very intuitive accident, which had orchestral music playing in the background and two brutal uncles talking to the beat.

    Suddenly, Harry lunged forward and tried to punch James in the face. Quickly, James grabbed the minuscule newspaper and brought it down on Harry's skull.

    Harry's wide lips trembled and his red ankles wobbled. He looked jumpy, his emotions raw like a rough, round rock.

    Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Harry Wishmonger was dead.

    James Parkes went back inside and made himself a nice glass of port.
