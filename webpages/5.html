    <h1>The Snow that Flurried like Running Puppies</h1>
    <h2>By Dave</h2>
    James Parkes had always loved urban Madrid with its grieving, glorious gates. It was a place where he felt sparkly.

    He was a witty, thoughtful, port drinker with pink lips and tall ankles. His friends saw him as a pleasant, pongy painter. Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved a cautious chicken. That's the sort of man he was.

    James walked over to the window and reflected on his pretty surroundings. The snow flurried like running puppies.

    Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Harry Wishmonger. Harry was a sinister elephant with wide lips and red ankles.

    James gulped. He was not prepared for Harry.

    As James stepped outside and Harry came closer, he could see the easy glint in his eye.
