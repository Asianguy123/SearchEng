    <h1>The Clouds that Danced like Chatting Gerbils</h1>
    <h2>By Felix</h2>
    Christiana Malkovich was thinking about Morwenna Kowalski again. Morwenna was a violent lover with brown warts and dirty toenails.

    Christiana walked over to the window and reflected on her dull surroundings. She had always loved beautiful Newton Abbot with its greasy, grated gates. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel ambivalent.

    Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a violent figure of Morwenna Kowalski.

    Christiana gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a vile, popular, wine drinker with ample warts and pretty toenails. Her friends saw her as a cheerful, cuddly carer. Once, she had even helped an elated baby bird cross the road.

    But not even a vile person who had once helped an elated baby bird cross the road, was prepared for what Morwenna had in store today.

    The clouds danced like chatting gerbils, making Christiana delighted. Christiana grabbed a warped book that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

    As Christiana stepped outside and Morwenna came closer, she could see the troubled glint in her eye.

    "Look Christiana," growled Morwenna, with a cold-blooded glare that reminded Christiana of violent kittens. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want equality. You owe me 6628 gold pieces."
