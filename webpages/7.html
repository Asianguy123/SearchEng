    <h1>The Clouds that Danced like Chatting Gerbils</h1>
    <h2>By Felix</h2>
    Christiana Malkovich was thinking about Morwenna Kowalski again. Morwenna was a violent lover with brown warts and dirty toenails.

    Christiana walked over to the window and reflected on her dull surroundings. She had always loved beautiful Newton Abbot with its greasy, grated gates. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel ambivalent.

    Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a violent figure of Morwenna Kowalski.

    Christiana gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a vile, popular, wine drinker with ample warts and pretty toenails. Her friends saw her as a cheerful, cuddly carer. Once, she had even helped an elated baby bird cross the road.

    But not even a vile person who had once helped an elated baby bird cross the road, was prepared for what Morwenna had in store today.

    The clouds danced like chatting gerbils, making Christiana delighted. Christiana grabbed a warped book that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

    As Christiana stepped outside and Morwenna came closer, she could see the troubled glint in her eye.

    "Look Christiana," growled Morwenna, with a cold-blooded glare that reminded Christiana of violent kittens. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want equality. You owe me 6628 gold pieces."

    Christiana looked back, even more delighted and still fingering the warped book. "Morwenna, d'oh," she replied.

    They looked at each other with healthy feelings, like two courageous, clear cats sitting at a very creepy funeral, which had flute music playing in the background and two loving uncles jogging to the beat.

    Christiana studied Morwenna's brown warts and dirty toenails. Eventually, she took a deep breath. "I'm afraid I declared myself bankrupt," explained Christiana. "You will never get your money."

    "No!" objected Morwenna. "You lie!"

    "I do not!" retorted Christiana. "Now get your brown warts out of here before I hit you with this warped book."

    Morwenna looked sad, her wallet raw like a pickled, powerful piano.

    Christiana could actually hear Morwenna's wallet shatter into 6628 pieces. Then the violent lover hurried away into the distance.

    Not even a glass of wine would calm Christiana's nerves tonight.
