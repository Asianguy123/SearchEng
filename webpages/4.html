    <h1>Dull Bangkok</h1>
    <h2>By Anon Emus</h2>
    Sophia Snozcumber had always loved dull Bangkok with its annoying, afraid arches. It was a place where she felt fuzzy.

    She was a proud, predatory, wine drinker with curvaceous fingernails and sloppy fingernails. Her friends saw her as a knowledgeable, kaleidoscopic knight. Once, she had even revived a dying, kitten. That's the sort of woman he was.

    Sophia walked over to the window and reflected on her old-fashioned surroundings. The sleet rained like walking rabbits.

    Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Elizabeth Willis. Elizabeth was a mean angel with solid fingernails and spiky fingernails.

    Sophia gulped. She was not prepared for Elizabeth.

    As Sophia stepped outside and Elizabeth came closer, she could see the defeated glint in her eye.

    Elizabeth gazed with the affection of 2705 caring kindly koalas. She said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want love."

    Sophia looked back, even more barmy and still fingering the weathered book. "Elizabeth, yabba Dabba Doo," she replied.

    They looked at each other with ecstatic feelings, like two rich, relieved rats gyrating at a very bold dinner party, which had jazz music playing in the background and two modest uncles shouting to the beat.

    Suddenly, Elizabeth lunged forward and tried to punch Sophia in the face. Quickly, Sophia grabbed the weathered book and brought it down on Elizabeth's skull.

    Elizabeth's solid fingernails trembled and her spiky fingernails wobbled. She looked ecstatic, her emotions raw like a repulsive, resonant record.

    Then she let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Elizabeth Willis was dead.

    Sophia Snozcumber went back inside and made herself a nice glass of wine.
