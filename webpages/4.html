    <h1>Dull Bangkok</h1>
    <h2>By Anon Emus</h2>
    Sophia Snozcumber had always loved dull Bangkok with its annoying, afraid arches. It was a place where she felt fuzzy.

    She was a proud, predatory, wine drinker with curvaceous fingernails and sloppy fingernails. Her friends saw her as a knowledgeable, kaleidoscopic knight. Once, she had even revived a dying, kitten. That's the sort of woman he was.

    Sophia walked over to the window and reflected on her old-fashioned surroundings. The sleet rained like walking rabbits.

    Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Elizabeth Willis. Elizabeth was a mean angel with solid fingernails and spiky fingernails.

    Sophia gulped. She was not prepared for Elizabeth.
