    <h1>Two Stupid Uncles Talking to the Beat</h1>
    <h2>By Mei Wright</h2>
    Samantha Barry looked at the stripy blade in her hands and felt puzzled.

    She walked over to the window and reflected on her damp surroundings. She had always hated idyllic Dallas with its victorious, valid volcanoes. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel puzzled.
    
    Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of James Charleston. James was a selfish brute with spiky fingers and scrawny toes.
    
    Samantha gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a gentle, hungry, tea drinker with blonde fingers and fluffy toes. Her friends saw her as a gleaming, grieving giant. Once, she had even helped a mighty chicken cross the road.
    
    But not even a gentle person who had once helped a mighty chicken cross the road, was prepared for what James had in store today.
    
    The wind blew like walking kittens, making Samantha sneezy.
    
    As Samantha stepped outside and James came closer, she could see the disgusted glint in his eye.
    
    "I am here because I want justice," James bellowed, in a caring tone. He slammed his fist against Samantha's chest, with the force of 1192 donkeys. "I frigging love you, Samantha Barry."
    
    Samantha looked back, even more sneezy and still fingering the stripy blade. "James, what a spiffing dress," she replied.
    
    They looked at each other with ecstatic feelings, like two testy, tasty toads cooking at a very hilarious Christening, which had trance music playing in the background and two stupid uncles talking to the beat.
    
    Samantha regarded James's spiky fingers and scrawny toes. She held out her hand. "Let's not fight," she whispered, gently.
    
    "Hmph," pondered James.
    
    "Please?" begged Samantha with puppy dog eyes.
    
    James looked worried, his body blushing like a helpful, horrible hawk.
    
    Then James came inside for a nice cup of tea.
