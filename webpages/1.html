    <h1>The Tattered Record</h1>
    <h2>By Lord Bam</h2>
    Charles Jameston was thinking about Melissa Parkes again. Melissa was a mean ogre with pretty legs and greasy fingernails.

    Charles walked over to the window and reflected on his dirty surroundings. He had always hated crowded Paris with its quirky, quickest quarries. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel calm.
    
    Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a mean figure of Melissa Parkes.
    
    Charles gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a funny, ruthless, port drinker with ample legs and skinny fingernails. His friends saw him as a greasy, giant giant. Once, he had even brought an annoying puppy back from the brink of death.
    
    But not even a funny person who had once brought an annoying puppy back from the brink of death, was prepared for what Melissa had in store today.
    
    The sleet rained like running elephants, making Charles stable. Charles grabbed a tattered record that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.
    
    As Charles stepped outside and Melissa came closer, he could see the shaky glint in her eye.
    
    "Look Charles," growled Melissa, with a cowardly glare that reminded Charles of mean humming birds. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a hug. You owe me 3814 dollars."
    
    Charles looked back, even more stable and still fingering the tattered record. "Melissa, I shrunk the kids," he replied.
    
    They looked at each other with jumpy feelings, like two super, spotty snakes bopping at a very gracious dinner party, which had jazz music playing in the background and two energetic uncles sleeping to the beat.
    
    Charles studied Melissa's pretty legs and greasy fingernails. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm afraid I declared myself bankrupt," explained Charles. "You will never get your money."
    
    "No!" objected Melissa. "You lie!"
    
    "I do not!" retorted Charles. "Now get your pretty legs out of here before I hit you with this tattered record."
    
    Melissa looked irritable, her wallet raw like a gifted, grim guillotine.
    
    Charles could actually hear Melissa's wallet shatter into 3814 pieces. Then the mean ogre hurried away into the distance.
    
    Not even a glass of port would calm Charles's nerves tonight.
